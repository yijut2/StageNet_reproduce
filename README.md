# StageNet_reproduce
The paper "StageNet: Stage-Aware Neural Networks for Health Risk Prediction" proposes a novel stage-aware neural network model (StageNet) for extracting disease stage information from patient data and integrating it into risk prediction. This repository is used to record the progress of paper reproducibility and all the revised models used.
